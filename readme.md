# Craft WW Code Test

## Approach:
My approach to this app was to first provide a solution that would allow users to create accounts and login to see their dashboard.  Users would be able to save and delete Subreddit posts to and from their dashboard.

## ERD:
![ERD](/public/img/erd.png)

## Technologies Used:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Node / Express

## Server-Side Dependencies:
* Users can run an 'NPM install' command upon downloading the app, which will implement the following dependencies:
  - bcrypt (1.0.2)
  - body-parser (1.17.2)
  - cors (2.8.3)
  - ejs (2.5.6)
  - express (4.15.3)
  - express-session (1.15.3)
  - jsonwebtoken (7.4.1)
  - method-override (2.3.9)
  - morgan (1.8.1)
  - node-fetch (1.7.0)
  - path (0.12.7)
  - pg-promise (5.7.1)

## Start Up Local Server
* To run this app locally - use the command 'nodemon' to spin up the Express server on your local host's 3000 port.

## Unfinished Issues
- Styling
- Wasn't able to finish CRUD functionality for users' saved posts

## Notes
- I took around a 1 hour break, so my commit history from start to finish is roughly 7 hours.
